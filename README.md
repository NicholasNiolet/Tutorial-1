Alright, so, what I want you to do.

Clone this repository. 

Create a branch and work in this new branch. 

Create a folder.

Create a file in that folder. 

Add, commit, and push these onto your branch. 

Then, go back to the master branch, and merge your branch with the master branch (this has multiple steps in one).
